# Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1 Sign in to GitHub: If you don't have an account, sign up at GitHub.

2  Create a New Repository:
Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository".

Name your repository (e.g., my-website).

Make sure the repository is public.

Optionally, add a README file.

Click "Create repository".

# Step 2: Add Your Website Files

Clone the Repository: Clone your repository to your local machine using Git. Open a terminal and run:

    $  git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-website.git


 
 Replace your-username with your GitHub username and my-website with your repository name.

 2 Add Your Website Files: Move your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files into the cloned repository folder.

    $ cd my-website
     git add .
     git commit -m "Initial commit"
     git push origin main


# Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

1 Go to Repository Settings:

Navigate to your repository on GitHub.
Click on the "Settings" tab.

2 Enable GitHub Pages:

Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
Under "Source", select the branch you want to use (e.g., main or master).
Choose the root folder (/).
Click "Save".

3 Get Your Website URL: After saving, GitHub will provide a URL where your site is hosted, typically https://your-username.github.io/my-website/.

 # Step 4: Update Your Website


 1 Make Changes Locally: Edit your files locally on your machine.

  2 Commit and Push Changes


   $ git add .
     git commit -m "Describe your changes"
     git push origin main


   Your changes will be automatically reflected on your GitHub Pages site.
